Sure! Here's a README file for the `results` folder that includes sections for downloading depth maps and point clouds from your Google Drive link.

# Results

This folder contains the results of the Multi-view Stereo Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction project. The results are divided into two main categories: depth maps and point clouds. You can download the results from the provided links below.

## Depth Maps

The depth maps generated from the multi-view stereo techniques (Colmap, gbinet, and mvsformer) are available for download. These depth maps represent the estimated depth information from the input images.

You can download the depth maps from [this link](your-google-drive-link-depth-maps).

## Point Clouds

The point clouds reconstructed from the depth maps are also available for download. These point clouds represent the 3D structure of the scene reconstructed from the depth information.

You can download the point clouds from [this link](your-google-drive-link-point-clouds).

## Structure

The results are organized into subfolders corresponding to each technique and the type of result:

```
results/
├── depth_maps/
│   ├── colmap/
│   ├── gbinet/
│   └── mvsformer/
└── point_clouds/
    ├── colmap/
    ├── gbinet/
    └── mvsformer/
```

- `depth_maps/colmap/`: Depth maps generated by Colmap.
- `depth_maps/gbinet/`: Depth maps generated by gbinet.
- `depth_maps/mvsformer/`: Depth maps generated by mvsformer.
- `point_clouds/colmap/`: Point clouds reconstructed using Colmap.
- `point_clouds/gbinet/`: Point clouds reconstructed using gbinet.
- `point_clouds/mvsformer/`: Point clouds reconstructed using mvsformer.

## How to Use

1. Download the results from the provided links.
2. Unzip the downloaded files into their respective directories (`depth_maps/` or `point_clouds/`).
3. Use the depth maps and point clouds for analysis, visualization, or further processing as needed.

For detailed information about how these results were generated, please refer to the main [README](../README.md) file in the root of this repository.

Replace `your-google-drive-link-depth-maps` and `your-google-drive-link-point-clouds` with the actual links to your Google Drive files. This README will help users understand the contents of the `results` folder and how to access the files.

# Results

This folder contains the results of the Multi-view Stereo Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction project. The results are divided into two main categories: depth maps and point clouds. You can download the results from the provided links below.

## Depth Maps

The depth maps generated from the multi-view stereo techniques (Colmap, gbinet, and mvsformer) are available for download from [this link](your-google-drive-link-depth-maps).

## Point Clouds

The point clouds reconstructed from the depth maps are also available for download from [this link](your-google-drive-link-point-clouds).

## Structure

The results are organized into subfolders corresponding to each technique and the type of result:

```

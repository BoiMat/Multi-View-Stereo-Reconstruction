### Depth Estimation and Error Analysis Script

The `depth_maps.py` script processes and evaluates the performance of the multiple depth estimation techniques. 
The script reads and preprocesses depth maps generated by these methods and compares them against ground truth depth maps to compute various error metrics. 
These metrics include Absolute Relative Error (AbsRel), Squared Relative Error (SqRel), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage of depth estimation errors above specified thresholds. 
The script iterates over a list of predefined folders, reads the respective depth map files, resizes them to a common dimension, and masks regions not containing the objects. 
It then calculates and logs the performance metrics for each method, providing a comprehensive comparison of their accuracy in reconstructing depth from multi-view stereo images.
